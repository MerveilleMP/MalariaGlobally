As someone who was born in the Benin Republic, malaria was always been something to be aware of. 
This was especially during the rainy season, and that came with a lot of people getting sick, and in unfortunate cases, death.
With all that in mind, when I saw this dataset, I knew I had to dig deeper into the dataset and see what malaria looks like globally, and its correlation with deaths.
Other factors were not looked at here, for example, hospital accessibility might have prevented some deaths.
